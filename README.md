# Software Engineering - Web Application: Parfemologija

Web Application that serves as an online local fragrance selling & information system. Developed with AngularJS & Java Spring boot. Key Points:
- MVC design architecture used on the frontend with TailwindCSS for styling
- Layered design architecture used on the backend (DAO, Serice, Rest)
- Monorepo structure for the entire project
- Online Postrgres database via Supabase

## Version 1.0 - Functions (Mostly Backend)
For this version we focused on creating the Backend carefully and preparing all the individual parts and components we will need for development later.
- Backend working API CRUD for Fragrances, Articles, Users, Brands...
- Authentication and Authorisation for the frontend
- Initial page structure and navigation for the frontend
- Four main pages to be implemented: Homepage, Browse Fragrances, Browse articles & Profile
